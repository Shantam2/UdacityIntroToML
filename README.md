__Low Recall and High Precision gives -__

Whenever a POI gets flagged in my test set, I know with a lot of confidence that it’s very likely to be a real POI and not a false alarm. On the other hand, the price I pay for this is that I sometimes miss real POIs, since I’m effectively reluctant to pull the trigger on edge cases.”

--------Basically, all who are identified are 100% correct but it misses a few


__High Recall and Low Precision gives -__

Nearly every time a POI shows up in my test set, I am able to identify him or her. The cost of this is that I sometimes get some false positives, where non-POIs get flagged.”


--------Basically, it finds all correct ones but includes few incorrect ones too
